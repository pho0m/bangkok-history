          <p>
            The governmental and commercial districts of the city occupy
            traditional sites. Government offices were originally housed in the
            walled compound of the 18th-century Grand Palace, but by the late
            19th century they occupied surrounding palaces and mansions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The bureaucracy then spread outward into nearby colonial-style or
            Thai-style office buildings and homes along Ratchadamnoen Road.
          </p>
          <p>
            Multistoried buildings have been erected to meet the ever-increasing
            demand for space, and the traditional government compounds have
            become overbuilt. A number of large camps around and north of the
            National Assembly Hall constitute the military area.
          </p>

            When Bangkok became the national capital in the 18th century and its
            citadel was moved to the east bank of the Chao Phraya River, Chinese
            merchants and tradesmen occupying the site moved a short distance
            southward to the area now known as Sam Peng. Business was at first
            carried on in one-story wood and thatch houses.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the early 1900s a number of streets had been lined with two-story
            masonry shop-houses. This ever-expanding district now contains rows
            of shop-houses that are sometimes five or more stories high.
            Warehouses line both banks of the river just south of Sam Peng,
            while industry is concentrated at Sam Rong, south of the port.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nightlife flourishes on Pat Pong Road. The financial district
            straddles Silom Road.In the Floating Market a variety of foods and
            merchandise are sold daily from boats on the canals near Wat Sai.
            Formerly several such markets and innumerable door-to-door floating
            vendors served the daily needs of the cityâ€™s residents.
