          <p>
            The population’s outstanding demographic characteristics—its youth
            and the low proportion of non-Thais—are explained by the high rate
            of natural increase and by the restrictive foreign immigration
            quotas adopted after World War II. Roughly two-fifths of the
            residents are under 20 years of age.
          </p>
          <p>
            The birth rate has declined since the introduction of a birth
            control program. At the same time, the net in-migration of young
            adults, particularly females, has increased greatly, so that more
            than a quarter of the resident population of the city is made up of
            migrant Thais from all parts of the country.
          </p>
          <p>
            Luxury housing, mostly for the wealthy foreign community, usually
            takes the form of large, modern, two-story masonry structures set in
            private compounds and equipped with separate servants’ quarters and
            kitchens. Bang Kapi is perhaps the most affluent neighbourhood.
            High-rise offices, hotels, and condominiums are increasingly common.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the city’s population are ethnic Thais. The Chinese are by
            far the largest minority, but there are sizable communities of other
            Asians, North Americans, and Europeans. Despite their small size,
            the foreign communities tend to live in certain areas. The Chinese
            concentrate in the commercial area of Sam Peng, Indians gather
            around mosques in the Wang Burapha section, and the Western and
            Japanese communities reside in the affluent, modern eastern section
            of the city.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of the foreign groups, the Chinese enter the most intimately into
            city life. They appear to assimilate readily, and intermarriage is
            frequent. Their offspring are Thai citizens, and many Chinese
            families take Thai surnames and are naturalized.
