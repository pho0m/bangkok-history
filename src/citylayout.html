          <p>
            Modern Bangkok has undergone explosive growth, which the authorities
            have attempted to direct by means of a series of master plans since
            the 1960s. The city centre, formerly enclosed by a wall, has long
            been densely developed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later expansion has sprawled outward well beyond the administrative
            boundaries into the surrounding agricultural areas.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some districts have evolved into functional units as the inner city
            has become more institutional and commercial and the outer city more
            residential and industrial. Throughout the city, walled Buddhist
            temples and monasteries called wats, often sumptuously ornamented,
            serve as focal points for religious, cultural, and even commercial
            life.
