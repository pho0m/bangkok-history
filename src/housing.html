          <p>
            Homes generally consist of small, detached one- or two-story wooden
            houses or row houses. Most of these are overcrowded because there
            are far too few of them to house the expanding population.
            Government programs alone are insufficient to meet the housing
            shortage, and funds from the World Bank have been used to build
            low-income housing, such as the Din Daeng and Hua Mak developments.
            The government allows squatters to occupy unused public land. The
            number of squatters is small, and most of them are concentrated in
            the Khlong Toei area near the port.

            Beginning in the 1960s, housing developed rapidly in the city. From
            the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s more than 100,000 new units were
            built. There was also an emphasis on renewal in inner-city areas.
            Private real-estate developers provide homes for middle-income
            groups, and many government agencies provide homes for their
            employees. Homes may be crowded onto small lots with rudimentary
            sanitation facilities. These developments have spread out
            haphazardly on the periphery of the city.

            Luxury housing, mostly for the wealthy foreign community, usually
            takes the form of large, modern, two-story masonry structures set in
            private compounds and equipped with separate servantsâ€™ quarters and
            kitchens. Bang Kapi is perhaps the most affluent neighbourhood.
            High-rise offices, hotels, and condominiums are increasingly common.
