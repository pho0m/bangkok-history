            The most important cultural feature of Bangkok is the wat. There are
            more than 300 such temples, representing classic examples of Thai
            architecture. Most are enclosed by walls. Many wats have leased a
            portion of their grounds for residential or commercial use.

            The National Museum houses prehistoric and Bronze Age art relics, as
            well as royal objects dating to the 6th century AD. The city also
            houses the National Library and the Thai National Documentation
            Department. Jim Thompson’s Thai House, named for a U.S. entrepreneur
            and devotee of Thai culture, is composed of several traditional Thai
            mansions.

            It contains the country’s largest collection of 17th-century Thai
            religious paintings. There are also collections of Dvaravati and
            Khmer sculpture, in addition to examples of Thai and Chinese pottery
            and porcelain.

            In 1987 the 200-acre (80-hectare) King Rama IX Royal Park with its
            extensive botanical gardens was opened to commemorate the king’s
            60th birthday.

            All of the country’s daily newspapers and most of its weeklies and
            monthlies are published in Bangkok. Newspapers are printed in Thai,
            English, and Chinese. Radio and television are controlled by
            government agencies and the military.

            Most of the nation’s radio stations and all of its television
            stations are located in or near Bangkok. Most programs are in Thai,
            but some special programs are in English and Chinese. Motion
            pictures are extremely popular. There is a thriving Thai cinema
            industry, but films are also imported.

            Fairs, festivals, and “kite-fighting” contests are held in the
            parks. The Ratchadamnoen and Lumphini stadiums host professional
            boxing bouts featuring the highly ritualistic form of boxing known
            as Muai Thai. Silapakorn National Theatre presents dancing, drama,
            and music.
